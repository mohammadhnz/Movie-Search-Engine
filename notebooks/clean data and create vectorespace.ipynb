After their con is exposed, the two evade the guards and hide aboard one of the ships to be led by Hern\\u00e1n Cort\\u00e9s for the New World. During the voyage, they are caught as stowaways and imprisoned, but break free and take a rowboat with the help of Cort\\u00e9s' horse, Altivo.\\r\\nThey reach an unknown shore at the edge of Mexico, where Miguel begins to recognize landmarks from the map, leading them to a totem marker near a waterfall that Tulio believes is a dead end. As they prepare to leave, they encounter a native woman, Chel, being chased by guards. When the guards see Tulio and Miguel riding Altivo as depicted on the totem, they escort them and Chel to a secret entrance behind the falls, into El Dorado. They are brought to the city's elders, kindhearted Chief Tannabok and wicked high priest Tzekel-Kan. The pair are mistaken for gods and given luxurious quarters, along with the charge of Chel. Chel discovers the two are conning the people but promises to remain quiet if they take her with them when they leave the city. The two are showered with gifts of gold from Tannabok, but disapprove of Tzekel-Kan attempting to sacrifice a civilian as the gods' ritual.\\r\\nTulio instructs Tannabok to build them a boat so that they can leave the city with all the gifts they have been given. During the three days this will take, Miguel explores the city, and Chel gets romantically close to Tulio. Miguel comes to appreciate the peaceful life the citizens seem to enjoy. When Tzekel-Kan sees Miguel playing a ball game with children, he insists the gods demonstrate their powers against the city's best players in the same game. Tulio and Miguel are far outmatched, but Chel is able to substitute the ball with an armadillo, allowing them to win. Miguel spares the ritual of sacrificing the losing team and chastises Tzekel-Kan, much to the crowd's approval. Tzekel-Kan notices Miguel received a small cut and realizes the two are not gods, because gods do not bleed. Tzekel-Kan conjures a giant stone jaguar to chase them through the city. Tulio and Miguel outwit the jaguar, causing it and Tzekel-Kan to fall into a giant whirlpool, thought to be the entrance to Xibalba. Tzekel-Kan then surfaces in the jungle, where he encounters Cort\\u00e9s and his men. Thinking Cort\\u00e9s is a god, he offers to lead them to El Dorado.\\r\\nWith the boat completed, Miguel says he will stay in the city. As Tulio and Chel board the boat, they see smoke on the horizon and realize Cort\\u00e9s is close. Tulio suggests using the boat to ram rock pillars under the waterfall and block the main entrance to the city. The plan succeeds with the citizens pulling over a statue in the boat's wake to give it enough speed. As the statue starts to fall too quickly, Tulio has difficulty in preparing the boat's sail. Giving up on staying in the city, Miguel and Altivo jump onto the boat to unfurl the sails, assuring the boat clears the statue in time. The group successfully crashes against the pillars, causing a cave-in but losing all their gifts in the process. They hide near the totem, just as Cort\\u00e9s' men and Tzekel-Kan arrive. When Tzekel-Kan finds the entrance blocked, Cort\\u00e9s brands him a liar, and takes Tzekel-Kan prisoner as they leave.\\r\\nTulio and Miguel, though disappointed they lost the gold (unaware that Altivo still wears the golden horseshoes with which he was outfitted in El Dorado), head in a different direction for a new adventure with Chel.\",\n          \"First Lieutenant Shunichi Maki of the Japan Air Self-Defense Force is a prestigious F-15 Eagle jet pilot. A lifelong fan of flying since he was a child, being a pilot is his ultimate dream. Unfortunately, his duties distance himself from his wife, Yoko, who feels neglected, and his son, Tsugumu, who has a possibly terminal congenital blood disease.\\r\\nMaki decides to quit the Air Force to devote more time to his family and to spend whatever time is left with his son. He takes a part-time job as a commercial tour guide for a kindly group of people who allow him time to take care of his family.\\r\\nPrior to quitting, Maki and his flight partner Yamashima are alerted to a strange red light streaking towards Japan, and Maki's plane passes through the red light seemingly without any damage. He suffers no ill effects other than strange images briefly playing out in his mind. He later discovers that the images are telepathic messages from a strange being that exists in the red light.\",\n          \"Sergeant Deadhead is a bumbling soldier who is sent to the guardhouse for blowing up a model rocket on the parade ground of the air base where he is stationed. His fianc\\u00e9e, Airman Lucy Turner despairs of ever marrying him because of him being constantly disciplined for his antics. She is worried that she will have to marry him while he is in the guardhouse.\\r\\nTogether with Private McEvoy, Sergeant Deadhead escapes from the guardhouse. Private McEvoy decides to break back in, but Sergeant Deadhead hides in a nearby space rocket, not knowing it is set to blast off with a chimpanzee aboard. He falls asleep in the rocket's control room and is accidentally blasted into space, together with the chimpanzee.\\r\\nWhen Sergeant Deadhead is discovered to be aboard the rocket, General Fogg decides to spin the facts and say that Sergeant Deadhead volunteered for the mission. He and Navy Captain Weiskopf also decide that Sergeant Deadhead and Airman Turner will have a well publicized wedding on the air base when Sergeant Deadhead returns to earth.\\r\\nWhen Sergeant Deadhead returns home he is a national hero but has also developed a massive ego due to space travel causing his personality to blend with that of the chimpanzee, and the realization that he has become a media sensation.\\r\\nA soldier who looks exactly like him, Sergeant Donovan, is found to take his place. When the smooth talking Sergeant Donovan is set to take Sergeant Deadhead's place at the altar, Sergeant Deadhead breaks out of the guardhouse, starts to recover his personality, and switches places with Sergeant Donovan. When the leadership realizes he has escaped the guardhouse, he runs away.\\r\\nSergeant Deadhead finds out about Sergeant Donovan, and goes to the hotel where the wedding reception and honeymoon are taking place. There he switches places with Sergeant Donovan to enjoy his honeymoon. However, General Fogg and the others find Donovan and take him back to the honeymoon suite, looking for Deadhead. Thinking Donovan is Deadhead, Airman Turner chases them out.\\r\\nWhen Airman Turner is preparing a bath for Donovan, Deadhead sneaks in the window and coldcocks Donovan with a vase, knocking him out. Fogg, Weiskopf and the others show up again at the door, claiming to have a message from the President. Thinking that Deadhead is Donovan, Fogg and Weiskopf have two MP's escort Deadhead and Turner to the airport to fly to see the President. Donovan awakes alone in the closet, then goes back to base where Fogg and Weiskopf discover that Deadhead is with Turner and going to meet the President. Deadhead and Turner enjoy the rest of their honeymoon and their meeting with the President.\\r\\nTwo marines appear to arrest Deadhead but mistakenly arrest the President, who is trying on Deadhead's space helmet. Deadhead and Turner escape in a White House helicopter. Fogg, Weiskopf and the others end up in the guardhouse.\"\n        ],\n        \"num_unique_values\": 33869,\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Release Year\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 27,\n        \"min\": 1901,\n        \"max\": 2017,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1945,\n          1905,\n          1954\n        ],\n        \"num_unique_values\": 117,\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Title\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Mayalodu\",\n          \"Dikari\",\n          \"En Rathathin Rathame\"\n        ],\n        \"num_unique_values\": 32432,\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

They abuse her and use her as the house maid. Cinderella thinks she's all alone in the world, but doesn't know a fairy godmother is constantly helping her. One day, she is collecting wood from the forest and meets Prince Charming. They immediately fall in love with each other, but lose contact. Soon, a ball is arranged by the prince to look for his future wife. The stepsisters think they make a great chance in being chosen by the prince. Cinderella wants to go as well, but isn't allowed to by her cruel family.\\r\\nThe sisters go to a fortune teller, who announces a member of the family will be chosen by the prince. The sisters are delighted and think it will be one of the two of them. When they leave for the ball, Cinderella is left behind. The fairy godmother appears and asks if she wants to go to the ball as well. When Cinderella responds positively, the fairy godmother orders her to bring her the biggest pumpkin she can find. Cinderella does so and the fairy godmother changes it into a luxurious stage coach. She next asks for the smallest mice she can find. Cinderella brings her some mice from the house and the fairy godmother changes them into horses.\\r\\nThe fairy godmother next orders her to bring her the biggest rats there are. After Cinderella collected them, the fairy godmother changes them into servants. She finally changes Cinderella's poor maiden costume into a dress fit for a princess, and glass slippers, of course. She reminds Cinderella she will have to be back at home before the clock strikes midnight. Otherwise, her fine dress will turn into rags and the coach and servants will become what they were before.\\r\\nAs Cinderella arrives at the party, Prince Charming is already busy looking for his future wife. It is soon announced an unknown lady has arrived in a coach. Prince Charming immediately chooses her and they go to a private place where they learn to know each other. As they flirt, Cinderella notices it is almost twelve o'clock and storms out. She loses her glass slipper, before she turns into her old poor self again.\\r\\nThe next day, the royal heralds announce the Prince's wish to marry the woman whose foot fits the lost glass slipper. The sisters go to the palace to try fit their feet into the slippers, while Cinderella is yet again forced to stay home. It becomes clear the royal heralds every woman of the town has tried but failed to wear the slippers, except for Cinderella. Prince Charming immediately goes to visit her and is shocked when he finds out she is a poor maid. He doesn't turn his back against her, though, and he invites her to try on the slipper. When she does, she is announced as the future princess. The royal heralds give her the opportunity to behead her sisters, but she refuses to.\\r\\nIn the final scene, the fairy godmother appears and blesses her. Cinderella and Prince Charming live happily ever after.\",\n          \"Paul Manning discovers one day that his dear friend and neighbor Ed Stander has been cheating on his wife.

With each new story, Paul can't help noticing the attractive blonde, Irma Johnson, who lives nearby.\\r\\nPaul gets close to cheating on his wife, Ruth, but he never quite goes through with it. In a scene near the end when he is in a motel room with another woman, Jocelyn, a wealthy divorcee, Paul hears sirens approaching. He looks out the window to see the police, and they are going to the room next door where his friend Ed is in bed with Mrs. Johnson.

Circumstances develop that result in Tiny Duffy, a local political leader Burden knows, urging Stark to run for governor. Burden\\u2019s upbringing makes him familiar with the undercurrent of politics \\u2013 he was raised by his loving godfather Judge Irwin, a former state attorney general, while his good friend, Dr. Adam Stanton, and his sister Anne Stanton -- also Burden\\u2019s former lover -- are the children of a former governor. Burden therefore decides to take Duffy's advice and travels as a reporter on Stark's campaign for governor.\\r\\nThe politically astute Burden soon deduces, and Duffy strategist (and Stark mistress) Sadie Burke confirms, that Duffy is using Stark to split his party's vote and thus allow the opposing party to win. They tell Stark, who begins to give speeches in a straightforward manner to appeal to the public, in defiance of the advice given to him by Duffy. His vigorous strategy attacks the corruption of the existing players and promises schools and roads for his \\u201cfellow ignorant hicks\\u201d, resulting in Stark winning the election. He manages Duffy by making him his lieutenant governor. Stark recruits Burden to work for him as an adviser.\\r\\nStark proves to be a very persuasive governor, delivering on many of his new projects. Irwin disapproves of Stark and publicly supports an investigation of possible graft in the new spending. Burden points out that graft is the elite\\u2019s word for what the previous politicians had always done, while Stark openly tells his crowds that his \\u201ccrooks, unlike theirs, are itty bitty\\u201d compared to the elite\\u2019s. Stark convinces Stanton to head a new public hospital while he begins having an affair with Anne, provoking Burke's jealousy and Burden's disappointment.\\r\\nIrwin continues criticizing Stark as political controversies begin to unfold. Stark demands that Burden seek information on the judge to be used against him. Jack insists that there is no such information, but eventually discovers evidence of a bribe that Irwin used to get his appointment many years prior, leading an opponent to commit suicide. Following this revelation, Irwin himself commits suicide. Burden\\u2019s mother then tells him that Irwin treated him with such love because he was his biological father, which causes a great amount of guilt for Burden.\\r\\nStark utilizes many methods of corruption to consolidate his power, including patronage and intimidation. Adam is told that Stark is using the hospital project to rob the state and is framing him in the process. Burden and Anne both assure Adam that this is false. Adam also becomes enraged when he learns of Stark's affair with his sister. Adam waits at the state capitol and assassinates Stark, only to be immediately killed by the governor's bodyguard. It is later revealed that Adam was influenced by Duffy and Burke to murder Stark, allowing Duffy to succeed Stark as governor.\",\n          \"Cinderella is a kind young woman who lives with her wicked stepmother and ugly stepsisters. They abuse her and use her as the house maid. Cinderella thinks she's all alone in the world, but doesn't know a fairy godmother is constantly helping her. One day, she is collecting wood from the forest and meets Prince Charming. They immediately fall in love with each other, but lose contact. Soon, a ball is arranged by the prince to look for his future wife. The stepsisters think they make a great chance in being chosen by the prince. Cinderella wants to go as well, but isn't allowed to by her cruel family.\\r\\nThe sisters go to a fortune teller, who announces a member of the family will be chosen by the prince. The sisters are delighted and think it will be one of the two of them. When they leave for the ball, Cinderella is left behind. The fairy godmother appears and asks if she wants to go to the ball as well. When Cinderella responds positively, the fairy godmother orders her to bring her the biggest pumpkin she can find. Cinderella does so and the fairy godmother changes it into a luxurious stage coach. She next asks for the smallest mice she can find. Cinderella brings her some mice from the house and the fairy godmother changes them into horses.\\r\\nThe fairy godmother next orders her to bring her the biggest rats there are. After Cinderella collected them, the fairy godmother changes them into servants. She finally changes Cinderella's poor maiden costume into a dress fit for a princess, and glass slippers, of course. She reminds Cinderella she will have to be back at home before the clock strikes midnight. Otherwise, her fine dress will turn into rags and the coach and servants will become what they were before.\\r\\nAs Cinderella arrives at the party, Prince Charming is already busy looking for his future wife. It is soon announced an unknown lady has arrived in a coach. Prince Charming immediately chooses her and they go to a private place where they learn to know each other. As they flirt, Cinderella notices it is almost twelve o'clock and storms out. She loses her glass slipper, before she turns into her old poor self again.\\r\\nThe next day, the royal heralds announce the Prince's wish to marry the woman whose foot fits the lost glass slipper. The sisters go to the palace to try fit their feet into the slippers, while Cinderella is yet again forced to stay home. It becomes clear the royal heralds every woman of the town has tried but failed to wear the slippers, except for Cinderella. Prince Charming immediately goes to visit her and is shocked when he finds out she is a poor maid. He doesn't turn his back against her, though, and he invites her to try on the slipper. When she does, she is announced as the future princess. The royal heralds give her the opportunity to behead her sisters, but she refuses to.\\r\\nIn the final scene, the fairy godmother appears and blesses her.

But everything goes topsy-turvy when, once Madumitha's marriage is arranged, she turns around and says that she was never in love with Muniyandi in the first place. Furious, the Muniyandi thrashes her with his slippers and sets fire to her father's coconut grove. Though she never reveal to this incident to anyone, Muniyandi on other hand discovers the secret behind his brothers death. Muni's brother was killed when he tries to help his friend who is in love with a girl of the other caste. Muni participates in college elections to go against Madhu's words. On the day of nomination Muni realizes that Madhu love him truly but had reverted from her feelings due to the request from his father to save his life. Muni convinces college students from conducting election in college and put a stop caste game in college. Ramaiyya and the other caste head were supposed to be killed by Raju (Muni's brothers friend and the old girl's lover), which Muni thwarts. Finally, Muni, with his father's acceptance, returns to Madhu (who was waiting for him near the temple) and unites with her.\"\n        ],\n        \"num_unique_values\": 35101,\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Release Year\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 29,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 2020,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1945,\n          1948,\n          1905\n        ],\n        \"num_unique_values\": 121,\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Title\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Ride\",\n          \"Demon Knight\",\n          \"Mana Oori Ramayanam\"\n        ],\n        \"num_unique_values\": 33714,\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",
