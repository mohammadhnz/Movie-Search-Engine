Deep world-building, intelligent dialogue, epic set-pieces worthy of Hollywood, expert acting, detailed plotting, genuine surprises, great soundtrack used sparingly. GoT is worth watching for these seasons, definitely.<br><br>Season 7: you suddenly notice the writing and plotting has taken a sharp dive downwards in quality. There are inexplicable ideas, inconsistent characterisation and soap-opera dramas. But at least the entertainment value is still very high, so it gets a pass.<br><br>Season 8: this drop chasms down to depths you didn't think possible. The writing has got so amateurish that the still-fantastic production values are no longer enough to save it. If you ever enjoyed Lost but were amazed at how bad the final season was, you're in familiar territory here.<br><br>The biggest problem with the final season was it took us out of the story and got us thinking about its many weaknesses. We lost our suspension of disbelief. Fatal for fiction. It also ruined the series-arcs to the point where a rewatch of the entire series is pointless.<br><br>So can I recommend a GoT marathon for newcomers? Yes, the first 6 seasons are worth the disappointments later on. But best series of all time it is not.

       "    'content': \"Was over-time on a gradual binge of watching 'Game of Thrones' from the first episode (gradual because of being so busy), having heard nothing but amazing things about it from friends, family and IMDb reviewers. Plus with such a great cast of talent and a brilliant book series, how could it possibly go wrong? <br><br>The good news is that 'Game of Thrones' didn't go wrong. Quite the opposite. Not only is it a rare television show that does its original source material justice and treats it with respect but it is on its own merits one of the finest, most addictive and consistently compelling shows in recent years. A television show so brilliant that one has to actually check that it was made for television when everything is done to such a high level that it puts many films made today to shame. This is one of the strongest examples of an acclaimed show that deserves every ounce of the praise it's garnered.<br><br>Visually, 'Game of Thrones' looks amazing. The scenery is throughout spectacular, the sets are hugely atmospheric and beautiful on the eyes with a real meticulous eye for detail and the costumes suit the characters to a tee. Then there are the special effects that are some of the best of any television programme and are not overused or abused, the scale, the detail and how they actually have character and soul are better than those in a lot of the big-budget blockbusters. As well the cinematography and editing, which are cinematic quality as well.<br><br>One cannot talk about 'Game of Thrones' without mentioning the thematically, orchestrally and atmospherically multi-layered music scoring and the unforgettable main theme. Again, worthy of a high-budget fantasy/action/drama film.<br><br>It is hard not to be bowled over by the quality of the writing, outstanding isn't a strong enough adjective to describe how good the writing is. It always has a natural flow, is layered and thought-provoking and demonstrates a wide range of emotions such as suspenseful tension, poignant pathos and witty humour. The story-lines are paced so beautifully, structured with such nuance and attention to coherence, a high emotional level and touch upon complex and sensitive themes with intelligence and tact.<br><br>Whenever there's a set-piece or more action-oriented scene there's always a reason, never there for the sake of it. Not only are the set-pieces done with a lot epic scale, superb staging, excitement and dramatic tension but underneath all the scale and flashy attention to detail there is a lot of heart and a multi-layered one. They're not overlong, nor are there out of place elements.<br><br>Characters are a huge part of the appeal too. 'Game of Thrones' has characters that are so well developed and as close to real life as one can get despite being in a fantasy world. These characters are not hero and villain archetypes (Joffrey is the only one close to that, the difference though is that he is an extremely interesting one with a lot of development who ranks well beyond one hundred percent on the threat level scale), they have much more to them and have strengths and flaws. Decisions are logical and one doesn't like any character any less when a decision is not the right one because mistakes are acknowledged and learnt from.<br><br>'Game of Thrones' cast is full of talented names and, thanks to so well rounded characters and such great writing, nothing but the very best is gotten out of them. Even those who are not favourites of mine. Big acting standouts are Peter Dinklage, Sean Bean, Lena Headey and Jack Gleeson (Joffrey being the king of all young characters with not a redeeming bone in their body).<br><br>In conclusion, absolutely outstanding and a rare television show worthy of being a cinematic modern classic. This review may sound superlatively hyperbolic, but to me 'Game of Thrones' is that good. 10/10 Bethany Cox\"},\n",

But all in all filled with great moments and good set up for the final season.<br><br>Season 8- 2/10. I actually don't know where or start. Season 8 is a joke. Terrible writing. Nothing makes sense. The writers have butchered most character developments and given hardly any satisfying conclusions to their story arcs.<br><br><ul><li>Brans story had no pay off at all and his whole role as the 3 eyed raven proved pointless against the Night King.</li></ul><br><br><ul><li>Jaime's redemption arc was cut off instantly with real no reason.</li></ul><br><br><ul><li>The Night Kings death was underwhelming. Infact all of episode 3 was poor, with no real structure and poorly written end to the main story line of the show. The battle was shockingly illogical and horrendous tactics. Zero white walker fights, limited deaths and ridiculous plot armour. Also editing was poor- some moments characters would be surrounded by hundreds of wights but then the next shot they were all gone. The plot armour ruined the battle of Winterfell. 'All' the Dothraki wiped out in seconds yet Samwell Tarly can fend them off. Laughable.</li></ul><br><br><ul><li>No Sansa and Cersei interaction of any sort which I would have liked to have seen. Although I appreciate this is just my personal disappointment rather than poor writing.</li></ul><br><br>-Rhaegal taken down by first 3 shots, yet Drogon dodges an Iron fleets worth of Scorpions at Kings Landing, just to serve the plot. I guess Euron forgot about Dany's dragon and her forces.<br><br>-Jon does nothing all season (why was he resurrected if he didn't end the long night or atleast become King? The whole point of his resurrection is because the lord of light claimed he was needed alive). Speaking of Jon, what was the point of his lineage? It didn't change anything apart from give us unconvincing tension between him and Danaerys. I kind of like Danaerys going mad but it needed a lot more time and thought put into it - It went too far too fast with no substantial development to justify her killing thousands of innocent people. Again, Laughable. It needed seasons of planning and transitioning her character. After Dany's death it just skipped to Tyrion's trial and no one seemed phased over her death.<br><br><ul><li>Anything that required any thought from the Writers was done off screen, like Arya and Sansa finding out about Jon's lineage.</li></ul><br><br><ul><li>Cersei, the clever mastermind who always has a deceitful plan up her sleeve does nothing but stand looking out of a window all season. What a waste of a character.</li></ul><br><br><ul><li>Ayra does not use her faceless abilities. How cool would it have been for something like Ayra shockingly kills Jaime in order to get his face and uses it to get close to cersei, she thinks she is safe then is stabbed whilst in the arms of her 'brother' who reveals to be Ayra. Atleast something like that may have been more satisfying a few bricks falling onto her.</li></ul><br><br><ul><li>Bran becomes king. Urghhh. He literally said countless times he could not be lord of winterfell or rule anymore. Why the sudden change of heart? No explanation? Oh typical.</li></ul><br><br><ul><li>Prince that was promised? Oh yeh let's forget about that too. Haha we fooled you audience.</li></ul><br><br>However, my main issue was not with what happened but with how it all happened. Rushed and made no sense.<br><br>Major let downs and bad dialogue throughout. There are some good moments like Brienne being Knighted, but even that becomes ruined when she sleeps with Jaime- their relationship was so much nicer just being about honour and respect for one another. Have to appreciate effort by cast, visual and music crew and the few decent scenes as a whole.<br><br>Overall- 9/10 purely on S1-7.\"},\n",

Not sure who of the cast had read it beforehand either. So bare that in mind.<br><br>Now the line Winter is coming is something everyone associates with the show, I just never expected this to come up so early in the show. What is surprising, at least during the first seasons of the show, is how many supposedly main characters fail to survive. This keeps the viewers on their tows.

Not sure how much influence the original author had there (he had only written material for the first 6 seasons of the show, the rest was made up).<br><br>Having said that, you can feel a drop in quality.

While many moments in the show do not match the moments in the book action for action and word for word, the plot is never sacrificed when doing this, and the alterations simply make the story a better fit for a one-hour television time slot.<br><br>In addition, new scenes (by which I mean scenes which never happened in the book at all) fit seamlessly into the greater plot, and help the audience with information they would only otherwise get via the narrative of the novel (EG: asides which explain character/world history).<br><br>Top form, HBO. Top form.\"},\n",

       "    'content': \"This epic series is set in a fantasy world like no other I can think of. It has the look of medieval Europe with rival families manoeuvring to take the Iron Throne on which the Kings of Westeros sit. As the series begins Robert Baratheon is the king and he invites this friend Ned Stark to be his Hand, most trusted advisor. This leads to Ned, his wife and daughters; Sansa and Arya, moving to the capital... it isn't long before they are caught up in court intrigue. Robert's wife is involved with her own brother; it is learnt that the children of the last slain king are still alive... and there are rumours that the dead are returning to life north of the wall in the far north, where Ned's illegitimate son Jon is stationed. They are expected to attack next winter!<br><br>As the series progresses rival families fight each other, form and break alliances. Other characters work for personal advancement knowing that if the move to soon or side with the wrong people their lives will soon be over. The villains are truly villainous; the heroes aren't as clear cut as one might expect. The cast of major characters is huge and events in the first season shockingly show that even those set up as lead characters can be killed off. There are fantasy elements; most notably three dragons belonging to Daenerys Targaryen; the White Walkers (the Army of the Dead); and magic of Melisandre, the Red Woman but for the most part things are gritty and real. Often that means brutal violence, quite a bit of nudity and lots of swearing... this of course means that the series won't be for everybody; however if you don't turn off in disgust in the opening few episodes you'll probably want to watch it all and love it. The cast does a phenomenal job; this includes many established actors as well as up and coming stars and people for whom this was their first acting job such as young actresses Sophie Turner and Maisie Williams who play Sansa and Arya Stark who's characters develop across many seasons in ways one wouldn't imagine when it started. There is also a stellar performance from Peter Dinklage who plays dwarf Tyrion Lannister; a character that dominates just about every scene he is in despite his diminutive size. Others who must be mentioned are Sean Bean, Emilia Clarke, Kit Harrington, Lena Headey, Aiden Gillen, Charles Dance and Jack Gleeson... to be honest I could go on listing almost everybody in it! The special effects are fantastic; one could almost believe that dragons are real after watching this. The world in which the series is set is filmed in a wide range of countries giving it a very real feel... gone are the days when a major US series set in numerous locations will be filmed entirely in Southern California or the Pacific North West! Overall I can only say 'Watch this' as I loved it from start to finish.\"},\n",
